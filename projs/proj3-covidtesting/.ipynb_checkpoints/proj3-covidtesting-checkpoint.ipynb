    "A large part of a scientific enterprise is the conversation that happens around a new study. Often the media reports simplify aspects and don't have enough space to go into the details of the original study. Reading the study with a background in data science will help you judge for yourself what you agree with and what you disagree with. But, it's not enough to just agree or disagree, you need to be able to describe your evidence for _why_ you agree or disagree. Look back through the critique and try to analyze what evidence Gelman is providing for his opinions."
