    "The goal of this lab is to explore the connections between data science and finance. We'll be using roulette as a simple game. We use games because the rules are relatively simple compared to complex finance and insurance instruments, but the ideas extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette) there are 37 numbers: zero through 36. Zero is colored green, the odd numbers are red, and the even numbers are black. A dealer rolls a ball on the spinning roulette wheel and the ball falls into the slot correspondiong with a random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A player may choose from many different types of bets. For example, they could choose to bet 1 dollar on \"red\". If the ball lands on a red (odd) number, the player wins otherwise they lose. The payout is a function of the probability of the even in the bet. The ball has a probability of 18/37 of landing on red and winning. The payout for this bet (set by the house is 1 to 1) which means if the player wins they get their money back; if they lose, they lose the bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use simulation to study the outcome of any betting strategy and find out the effects of changes to the rules. In particular, you might explore the effect of credit and incentives. For example, suppose you were given an incentive for winning a certain amount of money over the course of a round of 10 games (like an end-of-year bonus). These incentives can have a powerful influence on decisions players made and are worth exploring. These ideas relate to the 2008 financial collapse."

    "When a player picks a single number in roulette, the probability of winning is $1/37$ and the player wins 35 times the bet. The probability the player looses is $36/37$ and the player looses the amount they bet. To understand how much the player can expect to gain from a single bet, we can compute the expected value. It's the probability of the even times the gain/loss if the event happens summed over all of the possible events. In this case there are two events, so the expected value is"

At the end of year 1 if the trader makes money (return is greater than zero), the they get to keep playing. If they don't make money then the game is over for them. Financial institutions typically provide incentives for their employees and those incentives can become more stringent over time. Suppose that in year 2, the threshold is that the trader has to make 10 dollars (10 percent return on the 100 dollar bank). In year 2, the trader has to make 20 dollars. Keep increasing the incentive for 10 rounds. Make a cell for each year of play and experiment. You may be opposed to deploying your credit in the beginning and you may not need it, but as time goes on you may find it difficult to maintain that course. Write your thoughts on the structure of the system and the strategies you've employed in terms of what bets you made (single numbers, odds/evens, etc) and the amount of your bet. Have you been able to make it to the end of 10 years?"
